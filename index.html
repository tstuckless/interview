			<h3>Q: Why do you want to be a video game developer?</h3>
			<p>A: I wanted to be a game developer from a young age. The thought of creating my own world peaked my interest. I really wanted to also know how games worked behind the scenes and what properly drives them, how games look so good and how bosses are made. I also like challenges, and reading about what a game developer actually does I found this being the right field for me.</p>

			<h3>Q: What is difficult or frustrating for you within game development and how do you work to push past that?</h3>
			<p>A: Some things that I find are difficult in game development are the projects due in a short time and projects that are themselves difficult. Trying to organize time can really help with any projects that are due in a short time, such as using a day planner. Also, trying to get an early start on project will really help. Whereas with difficult projects, trying to crack at them early may help so you can ask the professor for help before it’s too late.</p>

			<h3>Q: What do you see yourself doing after you finish this program?</h3>
			<p>A: I see myself going a few different paths after I finish game development. One path I see myself going down is continuing school elsewhere in game development to further my skills. Another path I see myself going down is starting up my own company. This is my dream overall, and I hope that I can make it a reality.</p>

			<h3>Q: What excites you about game development?</h3>
			<p>A: One thing that excites me about game development is making my own company so there can be another developer in the Niagara Region, however I hope to open mine up and be public. Another thing that excites me is the year 3 capstone. I really like level design and whoever’s group I’m in I can hope to prove myself. </p>

			<h3>Q: What worries you about game development?</h3>
			<p>A: One thing that worries me about game development is that I won’t be able to find a job afterwards, since game development is pretty linear.</p>

			<h3>Q: What defines a good game to you?</h3>
			<p>A: A good game must play well and all the scripts must be on par with how the difficulty should be. For example; if a game is an easy play through such as Mario, there shouldn’t be a Bloodborne like boss at the very end. The game must also look decently, as long as no textures are missing and colliders are well placed. </p>

			<h3>Q: What makes video games so interesting?</h3>
			<p>A: Games are interesting because there is so much going on behind the scenes and there’s so much work to be done that’s it is amazing.</p>
